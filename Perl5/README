As of 0.8.0: Any documentation included is dubious at best.


This is an experimental piece of code to interface Perl 5 to the pilot-link
library. To use it, you will need to perform these steps:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make

If everything is working, you can "make install" as root to install this
interface system-wide. You can try "make test" before that.

(Note that I have only tested this with Perl 5.004, though I have no reason
to believe it won't work with earlier or later versions.)

For documentation (such as it is), please read test.pl.
