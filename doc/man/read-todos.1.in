.SH "USAGE"
Connect to a target Palm handheld and read the ToDo database, or read the
ToDoDB.pdb file from disk and print the entries found to STDOUT.

By default, the contents of your Palm's ToDo database will be written to
standard output in a simple text output format.

If you supply the \-f <file> argument, while omitting the \-p <port>
argument, and pass it in the filename of a Palm ToDoDB.pdb\-format file, the
entries in the ToDo database file will be written to STDOUT.

If you supply the \-p <port> argument, while omitting the \-f <file>
argument, the ToDo database on your Palm will be read and sent to STDOUT in
the same basic text format.
