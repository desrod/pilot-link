TODO for python-libpisock:

  - clean up prc.py from Pyrite/Publisher/palmdb-xml and include it
  - shadow class for pi_file
  - shadow class for DLP connection
  - shadow class for DLP database
  - wrap the pi-sync functions
  - wrap the netsync related functions
  - do something about pack/unpack of fundamental data types (maybe
    use Python code from Pyrite; consider a simple API which will
    allow adding other packer/unpackers more easily later)
  - examples
  - documentation
