* Changes from 0.9.5.0 to 0.9.5.1 [June 26, 2001]:

  - Added wrappers for all of the pi_file functions.  (However, if your only
    reason to use this library is prc/pdb access, note that a pure-Python
    prc/pdb library is coming soon.)

  - Renamed the C module to "_pisock" and made the "pisock" module a Python
    wrapper that imports everything from _pisock.  This will enable the
    addition of shadow classes and the like.
